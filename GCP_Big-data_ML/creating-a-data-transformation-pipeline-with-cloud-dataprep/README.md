# Creating a Data Transformation Pipeline with Cloud Dataprep

## Overview
Cloud Dataprep by Alteryx is an intelligent data service for visually exploring, cleaning, and preparing structured and unstructured data for analysis. 


In this demo I explored the Cloud Dataprep UI to build a data transformation pipeline that outputs results into BigQuery.

The dataset used is an ecommerce dataset that has millions of Google Analytics session records for the Google Merchandise Store loaded into BigQuery. I explored the available fields and row for insights.
